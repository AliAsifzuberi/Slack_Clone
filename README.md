# Slack_Clone
Created a slack clone in swift. Users are able to sign up using Facebook, Google, or email. Once signed in users are able to create gorups with specifc group title and description. The group leader can go and add users to the group. Everyone in the group can now chat together very similar to slack. Next steps for this project is to allow users to create invite links and voice channels.
